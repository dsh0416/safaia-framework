## Brief
Safaia is designed to be an easy developing, maintaining, deploying light web framework with high performance on C++. The inspiration of the framework comes from a gem on Ruby whose name is Sinatra. So that, the name of Safaia comes from the Japanese accent pronunciation of Sapphire to pay the respect of the designer of Ruby.
