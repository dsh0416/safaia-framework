# Tutorial

## Brief Introduction
Safaia framework is designed for high performance and concurrency web server with C++. It's easy to use, test and deploy. 

## Getting Started
First off, you should clone the whole project to your own disk. To make this happen, open your Terminal, and type the following command.

`git clone https://github.com/dsh0416/safaia-framework.git`

Safaia framework use `CMake` to build the project. It's easy to find the `CMakeList.txt` file under the project directory. `CMake` is a powerful tool to build your project. You'd better learn how to use it [here](http://www.cmake.org/). IDEs like `CLion` could automatically manage and build with `CMake`.

After you build the server, you could just run the executive file.

Type `http://127.0.0.1:21411/` in your browser and you would see a `Hello World` page in your browser. We will later describe how it works in Safaia-framework.
